🌍 AI Climate Action Dashboard
An AI-powered sustainability analytics platform designed to support SDG 13: Climate Action by providing real-time climate insights, predictive analysis, and actionable recommendations through AI assistance.

🚀 Project Overview
The AI Climate Action Dashboard helps visualize and interpret environmental metrics such as CO₂ emissions, temperature trends, air quality, and renewable energy usage. Leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Agentic AI, it engages users in an interactive way to understand sustainability patterns and take informed decisions.
